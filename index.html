                <h2 class="sub-title">Who is Aerhon?</h2>
                <p>
                    Aerhon Fortunato is a dedicated student-athlete who has been balancing academics and sports since grade 6. Currently, he is pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT) at Columban College Main, under the College of Computer Studies. Aerhon's journey has shaped his resilience and commitment to both his studies and athletic pursuits.

                <p>
                    Aerhon loves his sport, Athletics Track and Field, because it has been instrumental in shaping who he is today. The thrill of competition and the discipline required for training have taught him valuable lessons in perseverance and goal-setting. Through track and field, he enjoys the camaraderie with teammates and the sense of achievement that comes from pushing his limits, which has greatly enriched his overall experience as a student-athlete.

                <p>
                    His favorite line, "The support was silent, but the congrats were loud," reflects his experience in athletics, particularly in track and field. Unlike ball games like basketball, where the crowd's energy is palpable, track events often have a quieter atmosphere. However, in the end, when he achieves success, the heartfelt congratulations from family, teammates, and coaches resonate deeply with him. That contrast highlights the unique bond within his sport, where personal triumphs are celebrated with enthusiasm, even in the absence of a loud crowd.
